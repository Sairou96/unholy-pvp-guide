            This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to play in a PvP environment. The guide will cover everything from talent choices, PvP talents, gameplay and rotation, and useful racial bonuses. It is most applicable to Arena content, but most talents and racial bonuses will work in Rated Battlegrounds and skirmishes.

    <p>
        Unholy Death Knights are the most unique melee specialization in the game. Most of their damage comes from their pet. Not only that, but they have to keep track of two resources: Runic Power and Runes. Unlike other melee classes that have strong single- target damage, Unholy Death Knights have the ability to AoE down entire teams. To add to this, you also have to maintain buffs, diseases, your pet and Runic Power. Unholy Death Knights are one of the hardest melee classes to master, but are certainly worth learning.
